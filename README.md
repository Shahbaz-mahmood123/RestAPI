# RestAPI
A REST API built in django, just trying to get better at backend dev using django and its rest framework. 

Initially was going to build a note taking application(hence please ignore the folder names that need updating. but switched over the more of a bug tracking application simmilar to jira. the goal is to eventually build out a front end using react, vue js of another front end framework. 

Some key things I am trying to implement: 
- Good REST API Desgin.
- Unit testing all endpoints. 
- Implementing JWT Authentication
- Good database design.
- Trying out TDD.
